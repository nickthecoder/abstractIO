To Do
=====

Fix IO Expansion board, and test the example.

Test the DIYduino board.

Test examples : AnalogMux, MCP23017, FadeLED, Mux, Selector

Implement external PWM output. The library look nasty, low level stuff, that is nowhere near obvious how it works!

Create an IR Output (sends an IR signal) - One class per protocol.

New class for rotary encoder

RF Transmitter / Reciever
Create RFButton similar to the IRButton
