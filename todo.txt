To Do
=====

Test the DIYduino board.

Test examples : AnalogMux, Mux, Selector

Implement external PWM output. The library look nasty, low level stuff, that is nowhere near obvious how it works!

Create an IR Send (sends an IR signal) - One class per protocol.
    Note, this shouldn't be a subclass of Output.

RF Transmitter / Reciever
    Create RFButton similar to the IRButton
    The "send" should also share the same interface with IR Send
