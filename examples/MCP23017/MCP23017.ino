/* 
Does the same as the SimpleInputOutput example, but uses an MCP23017 IO Extender, using 5 of the additional 16 GPIO pins.
The main body of code is identical to the SimpleInputOuput example, to demonstrate that only the setup code needs to
know the details of how your project is wired.

Turns an LED on when switch A is held down, when switch B is pressed another LED lights, and when B is released it gives
a double flash. A third LED behaves the same for a second button.

Connect I2C clock (A5) to pin 12 of the MCP23017 and I2C data (A4) to pin 13 of the MCP23017

Connect buttons with pull up resistors to data lines 2 and 3 (pins 23 and 24 or the MCP23017)
Connect LEDs from +5V to data line 3 and 4 (pins 25 and 26) of the MCP23017 via suitable resistors.

Use the "default" I2C address by tieing pins 15,16 and 17 to ground.
Tie the reset (pin 18) of the MCP23017 to 5V (it's active LOW).
Power the MCP23017 by connecting pin 9 to ground and pin 11 to 5V.
