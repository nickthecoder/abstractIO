/*
 * A rotary encoder is a tricky beast, because if you poll the outputs (i.e. check the outputs once per loop() ),
 * then it is very easy to miss a beat if the loop is longer than the time between beats.
 * Therefore only use SimpleRotaryEncoder if your loop() is very quick, or if you don't mind when beats are missed.
 * 
 * A common solution is to use interrupts to monitor the RE, however, the Arduino only has 2 interrupts,
 * and therefore can only handle a single encoder. Alternatively a timer can also be used to monitor multiple
 * encoders. I may well use this method here later...
 * 
 * However, my long term solution involves a small PIC microcontroller to monitor the rotartary encoder
 * which the Arduino can talk to via an I2C interface. Small PICs are less than Â£1 from China (47p each),
 * so the extra hardware isn't expensive.
 * You can then have as many encoders as you like by changing the I2C address on each PIC.
 * The cheap 12F686 has 6 data pins. 2 for I2C and three for the encoder (including a push button), leaving a spare pin,
 * which could be used for a status LED for each encoder.
